                <h1>Picasso in A Coruña</h1>
                <small><em>Article from - theartwolf.com</em></small>
                <p>Rightly or wrongly, all the studies on the life and art of Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) tend to divide it into stages or periods, perhaps in an attempt to make more understandable and accessible his vast career. So much has been written about his origins in Malaga, on his training as an artist in the same city, his hard beginnings in Montmartre, Paris, and his later success as a famous artist in the French capital. However, there is a stage in the life of Pablo Picasso that remains, at least for the general public, as unknown, a sort of loophole in the popular career of the great genius of the visual arts of the twentieth century: his brief but decisive period in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain (1891-1895), a key time in the artist's formation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We have defined this period in A Coruña as "almost unknown", although this is a definition that is certainly risky to be offensive for many experts in the artist's life and oeuvre, and so we apologize in advance. But it's true that this stage remains a bit "anonymous", at least for the general public. Therefore, we are going to approach the readers to this period from a well known point in the painter's career, from which we are going to go temporarily back to our starting point, aiming in this way that the reader could locate Picasso's stage in A Coruña in the huge and complex artistic life of the artist.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>The context: A Coruña in Pablo Picasso's life and career</strong></p><br>
                <p>We are in 1937. A 55 years old Pablo Picasso is in his full artistic maturity and has just completed his most famous painting -The "Guernica"- that would become the eternal symbol of protest against the barbarity of the war. Just a few years back, we find Picasso immersed in his very personal understanding of Surrealism, embodied in the figure of the "Minotaur" and the sexy and colorful portraits of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter. Immediately prior to this period is an approach to classicism, with such famous works as "La Flute de Pan" (Paris, Musée Picasso) or the "Harlequin with mirror" in the Thyssen Museum in Madrid.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Let's go back to the period immediately preceding the First World War. A Picasso in his early 30s creates, along with Georges Braque, the most decisive of the vanguards of the past century, the Cubism, which began with the painting that can be considered as the most important and revolutionary of the twentieth century, "Les demoiselles d'Avignon". We are now in 1907. Immediately prior to this period we find Picasso's fascination with African art, a brief period, but of enormous importance to the artist's later works.</p>
                <br>
                <em>In Conclusion</em>
                <p>We have retreated to the last half of the nineteenth century, when a teenager Picasso creates in Barcelona some of his early works, quite well known today for the art lovers, starting with "The First Communion" (1895), an incredible realist canvas that make us understand the words of the artist: "It took me 12 years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child". Picasso was then 13 years old and had just arrived in Barcelona with his family, from a city where he had spent the last 4 years of her childhood: A Coruña.</p>
