                <h1>HardFork Concept In CryptoCurrency</h1>
                <small><em>Article by - Judith Seaport</em></small>
                <p>Hard fork is when a block is broadcast under a new and different set of protocol rules, probably due to changes in the top echelon of the community which is accepted by nodes that have upgraded to support the new protocol. One main cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, and this article will be centralized around it. In the case of Bitcoin, Bitcoin diverges from a single block chain to two separate block chains (a majority chain and a minority chain).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hard forks are simply protocol upgrades and if you desire better designed Bitcoin protocol, you have to upgrade (fork) frequently to make it happen. A programmed fork is no cause for worry. <strong>IT IS IMPORTANT TO STORE YOUR BITCOIN IN WALLET WHERE YOU HAVE CONTROL OF THE PRIVATE KEY.</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>As it relates to block chain technology, a hard fork (or sometimes hard fork) is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa), and as such requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. Put differently, a hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the block chain, and nodes running previous versions will no longer be accepted by the newest version. This essentially creates a fork in the block chain, one path which follows the new, upgraded block chain, and one path which continues along the old path. Generally, after a short period of time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the block chain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The biggest risk in executing a hard fork is a situation where nodes running the new software are separated from the previous version, resulting in a fork of the block chain. If half of the nodes are running the latest version and mining blocks, and the other half are running the older version and mining a different set of blocks, then you would have two different chains resulting in a fork of the block chain (which is different from a fork of the software).</p>
                <br>
                <em>In Conclusion</em>
                <p>Bitcoin is strongly anti-fragile, meaning that a complete destabilization of the entire network is extremely difficult. Hard fork is a goldmine in cryptocurrency that is under-harnessed by lots of crypto traders, with these robust and first-hand information about hard fork, I hope you will be able to maximize your profits with the next planned hard fork to come.</p>
